For each neighborhood, generates [largest inscribed rectangle](http://d3plus.org/blog/behind-the-scenes/2014/07/08/largest-rect/)

![Largest Inscribed Rectangle](images/inscribedSingle.png)

Finds remaining space on all sides, eliminating space that's not useful (space above center rectangle in this example) and again finding largest inscribed in remaining space.

Divides given phrase into appropriate portions for each rectangle and appends text inside rectangles.
