Facebook:
    Places API: center and radius, just like Twitter.

Zillow
    Promising! 
   "Zillow Home Value Index, Zestimate distribution, median single family home and condo values, average tax rates, and percentage of flips.
    Demographic data at the city and neighborhood level"

    Zillow Home Value Index:
        median Zestimate valuation for a given area on a given day (it changes!) 
        (we don't want to average because that is sensitive to extreme values)

    Zestimate distribution:
        Zestimate: zillow's estimate of the current market value for a home
